## ðŸ“¦ Types Ported from TypeScript

This crate includes a set of Rust types that were ported from a TypeScript codebase originally published under the MIT license.

The original TypeScript definitions come from the repository:

**[github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types)**  
Licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

### Porting Notes

- All TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums were translated into Rust equivalents.
- Some types were simplified or restructured to better fit Rust's type system and ownership model.

### License and Attribution

The original TypeScript definitions are Â© their respective authors.  
This Rust adaptation retains the original MIT license and includes full attribution.

If you use these types in your own project, you're free to do so under the terms of the MIT license.  
Please consider crediting both this crate and the original TypeScript source.
