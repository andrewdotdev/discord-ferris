/// Responsibilities:
/// - Sends heartbeats at a fixed `interval_ms` (from the Gateway HELLO payload).
/// - Sends an *immediate* heartbeat if `immediate_rx` receives a signal (op=1 request from Gateway).
/// - Always includes the latest known sequence number from `last_seq_rx` in the heartbeat payload.
/// - Listens for a shutdown signal (`shutdown_rx`) and stops gracefully when triggered.
///
/// This loop should be spawned in its own task after receiving HELLO, **before** sending IDENTIFY or RESUME.
/// The Gateway expects heartbeats to start immediately after HELLO, and to continue at the exact interval.

/// - `writer_tx`: The sending channel for Gateway messages (owned by the writer task).
/// - `seq`: The most recent sequence number (`s`) observed from Gateway dispatches.
///
/// Notes:
/// - The payload format is: `{ "op": 1, "d": <seq_or_null> }`.
/// - Discord requires this `d` value to be the last sequence received, or `null` if none has been received yet.
/// - This function is synchronous because `mpsc::UnboundedSender::send` is non-blocking.
