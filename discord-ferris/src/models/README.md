# üì¶ Discord API Types (Rust Port)

This folder contains a set of Rust types adapted from the original TypeScript definitions published by the [`discord-api-types`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types) project.

## üîÑ Porting Notes

- All TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums were translated into idiomatic Rust equivalents.
- Some types were simplified, renamed, or restructured to better fit Rust's type system, ownership model, and crate conventions.
